This module is meant to be installed on a minion which is configured
as an admin host for one or more NetApp filers.  Since we can't get
our funcy awesomeness on the actual filer the admin host will have to do.

Requirements:

- passphraseless ssh key access from root on the netapp admin minion
  to root on the target filer
